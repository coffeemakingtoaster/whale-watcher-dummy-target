      The apt sources are generally not needed in a production image and therefore only add bloat and attack vectors. Installing apt packages after container start violates the idea of an immutable container.

      The root user is the most powerful user on a linux machine. Running a process adds additional risks in the case of said process being vulnerable. In most cases, starting the process as a 'weaker' user is sufficient.
